# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains two deep learning projects that explore the applications of neural networks in different domains:

1. **Pneumonia Detection**: Classification of pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2. **Flower Classification**: Identifying flower species using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs).

## Overview

Deep learning has revolutionized various fields, from healthcare to image recognition. This repository showcases two implementations of deep learning models:

- A CNN-based model for detecting pneumonia from medical images.
- An MLP-based model for classifying different species of flowers.

Both projects aim to provide insights into the practical application of deep learning techniques.

## Project 1: Pneumonia Detection

This project focuses on identifying pneumonia from X-ray images using a CNN. Key features include:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to handle medical images.
- A custom CNN architecture designed for image classification tasks.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project 2: Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the use of an MLP to classify flowers into different categories. Highlights include:

- Feature extraction and preprocessing for structured data.
- Implementation of a fully connected neural network using an MLP.
- Training and validation with performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: All implementation and analysis are documented in Jupyter Notebook files.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Models are implemented using popular deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
- **Data Visualization**: Tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizing results.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyabesbes/Deep-Learning.git
   cd Deep-Learning
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: Add a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies if not already present.)*

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

   Start Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directories to execute the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in each notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
